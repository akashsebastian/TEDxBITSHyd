            <h2>Anuradha Thakur</h2>
            <h3>Why I Use Black in My Paintings</h3>
            <p>Anuradha is the Indian artist who has captured the essence of India’s tribal people in all their spirit and sanctity. Anuradha’s paintings have been influenced by the lifestyles of tribes during her association with Dr. Abhay Bang. She worked among the tribes of Gadchiroli area which gave her deeper insight. Further her extensive travels across India gave her a wider experience with various tribes in the region which are Gujrat , Jhabua, Assam , Northeast and Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh.
She has since created several series of paintings based on tribal life, traveling to remote parts of India. She has sensitively brought out simplicity, transparency, contentment in life and Celebration of life using black on white canvas with earthen colors. It’s appreciable that she has shown different textures using thin black lines to express minute details, emotions and depth in her paintings.
Anuradha’s first series ‘Autumns Harmony’ was in stark black and white where the delicate black lines brought the sensitivity of the tribes. Her journey into kutch tempted her to add colors in the series ‘music of life’, otherwise black and white paintings. But what metamorphosed her to use ample of earthen colors are the Jhabua tribes and their festivities. Yet through all this transformation, she has retained her signature style to bring out sensitively emotions like expectation, shyness and fun in stark black color. One also experiences the way women are portrayed with respect and honor.
Her work which focuses on the internal world of Tribal, Traditional life and culture links us deep into another world with its own internal pulse and rhythm.</p>

Despite multiple bullet injuries, he refused to be evacuated and continued the charge. Inspired by his gallant act, the platoon charged on the other positions with renewed punch and captured Tiger Hill Top."

                                    TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference
                                    in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two
                                    annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or
                                    less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill
                                    Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi
                                    Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.
                                    The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media
                                    initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project,
                                    which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers
                                    worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where
                                    exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into
                                    action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style
                                    events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around
                                    the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.
